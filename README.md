## Day 3 - 100 Days of Code (Udemy)

Welcome to Day 3 of my coding journey 
Today was all about learning **control flow** in Pythonâ€”basically how to make programs make decisions!  

## What I Learned
- How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Combining conditions with logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`
- Using the modulo operator `%` for things like checking odd/even numbers

## Projects I Built
1. **Odd or Even Checker** â€“ tells if a number is odd or even  
2. **BMI Calculator** â€“ gives health interpretation based on BMI score  
3. **Leap Year Checker** â€“ finds out if a year is a leap year  
4. **Pizza Order Program** â€“ calculates the bill based on choices  
5. **Love Calculator** â€“ a fun mini project combining strings and logic  

Iâ€™m documenting this as part of the Udemy **100 Days of Code Bootcamp by Angela Yu**. The goal is to practice daily, share progress, and improve step by step. ðŸ’¡
